A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took


Your app must:


Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models



Necessary Deliverables
Consume and/or serve an API
A working API, hosted somewhere on the internet


A working front-end, hosted somewhere on the internet
Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
