## GENERAL APPROACH

decided on react native as front end framework after finishing react todo tutorial. Spent some time getting hello world RN app to work.

still wasn't sure what the project was going to be as I added node and express to the stack. 

All of my ideas centered around relational data so I knew I wanted to use PSQL for my db. 

After a lunch and learn on Monday from anthony romero at spruceLabs the prospect of utilizing AI to create a chat-bot as a feature seemed way more feasible. Without much realization I recognized that the application I had begun to map was essentially an AIAD - artificially intelligent assistant director.
